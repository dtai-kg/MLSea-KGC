Steam is the world's most popular PC Gaming hub, with over 6,000 games and a community of millions of gamers. With a massive collection that includes everything from AAA blockbusters to small indie titles, great discovery tools are a highly valuable asset for Steam. How can we make them better?


# Content

This dataset is a list of user behaviors, with columns: user-id, game-title, behavior-name, value. The behaviors included are 'purchase' and 'play'. The value indicates the degree to which the behavior was performed - in the case of 'purchase' the value is always 1, and in the case of 'play' the value represents the number of hours the user has played the game.


# Acknowledgements

This dataset is generated entirely from public Steam data, so we want to thank Steam for building such an awesome platform and community!


# Inspiration

The dataset is formatted to be compatible with [Tamber][1]. Build a Tamber engine and take it for a spin! 

Combine our collaborative filter's results with your favorite Machine Learning techniques with Ensemble Learning, or make Tamber do battle with something else you've built.

Have fun,
The Tamber Team
